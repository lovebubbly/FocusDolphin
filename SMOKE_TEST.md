# FocusWhale Goal 1 Smoke Test

Use a local Chromium or Naver Whale profile with the unpacked `dist/` extension loaded after `npm run build`.

## Console Checks

1. DNR rules
   - Start a medium blocklist session for `example.com`.
   - In the extension service worker console:
     ```js
     await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules()
     ```
   - Expected: one redirect rule in the `1-999` range with `resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]` and `requestDomains: ["example.com"]`.

2. Alarms
   - In the service worker console:
     ```js
     await chrome.alarms.getAll()
     ```
   - Expected: `focuswhale:session-end` exists while a session is active. Temporary allows add a `focuswhale:temp-allow:<domain>` alarm.

3. Storage
   - In the service worker console:
     ```js
     await chrome.storage.local.get(["activeSession", "tempAllows", "sessionLog", "intentLog"])
     ```
   - Expected: `activeSession` is present during a session, `tempAllows` appears after a medium override, and completed/aborted/interrupted sessions are appended to `sessionLog`.

4. History/back behavior
   - Open a blocked domain, use the blocked page `되돌아가기` button.
   - Expected: the tab navigates back when history exists. If there is no prior history, the page attempts to close the tab.

## Manual Scenarios

1. Medium blocklist
   - Create a blocklist containing `example.com`.
   - Start a medium session.
   - Visit `https://example.com`.
   - Expected: the blocked page shows the domain, remaining time, and an empty `div#pet-slot`.
   - Click `그래도 열기`, wait for the 30 second countdown, enter one line of intent, and submit.
   - Expected: `intentLog` records the reason, a 5 minute temp allow rule is installed in the `1000-1999` range, and after the temp allow alarm expires the site is blocked again.

2. Hard allowlist
   - Create an allowlist with only a known safe domain such as `developer.chrome.com`.
   - Start a hard session.
   - Visit a domain outside the list.
   - Expected: the blocked page shows no temporary allow UI. Only `비상 종료 요청` is available.

3. Emergency valve
   - During a hard session, click `비상 종료 요청`.
   - Expected: the page shows a 5 minute countdown. The service worker has `focuswhale:emergency-end`, and the session finalizes as `aborted` after the alarm.

4. Browser restart restore
   - Start a medium or hard session, close and reopen the browser before `endsAt`.
   - Expected: `onStartup` reconciles `activeSession`, reinstalls DNR rules, and recreates the session-end alarm.
   - Repeat with a session whose `endsAt` is already in the past before startup.
   - Expected: it is recorded in `sessionLog` with `status: "interrupted"` and active rules are removed.

5. Soft overlay
   - Start a soft session for a blocklisted domain.
   - Visit that domain.
   - Expected: a full-page shadow DOM overlay appears, `계속하기` enables after 10 seconds, and `되돌아가기` is available immediately.

## Whale Result Recording

Codex did not execute real Whale checks. Fill this section after running the checklist in Naver Whale.

| Area | Command / Flow | Expected | Actual | Pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DNR | `chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules()` | session rules use `main_frame` and expected id ranges |  |  |
| Alarms | `chrome.alarms.getAll()` | session, schedule, temp allow alarms appear as applicable |  |  |
| Storage | `chrome.storage.local.get(...)` / `chrome.storage.sync.get(...)` | sessions, stats, settings, pet state remain local |  |  |
| History | `chrome.history.search({ text: \"\", maxResults: 10 })` | Whale browsing history is returned |  |  |
| Options | hard session then options edit attempt | options UI read-only; SW rejects list/schedule changes |  |  |

## Chromium-Reproducible Checks

Codex did not launch Chromium because manual browser checks are out of scope for this run. Use the same rows above in Chromium to separate extension defects from Whale compatibility issues.
